Notes and Known Issues

(Note) The Game has a 1 life policy, so if you die your save file is destroyed

(Visual Issue) In some rare instances the route will look “off”. It  will look like it loops around. This is a rare case, but the game still operates normally.

(Visual Issue) In the rare case both the player and enemy die at the same time, only one explosion effect will appear instead of both.
